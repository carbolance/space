# Future System Development (App Vision)

The **space** will eventually evolve into a larger **content & context system** — an app that connects copy, assets, and brand guidelines as a full creative engine.

## Objectives

- **Front-end Editor**: Rich-text + Markdown editor for non-technical teammates.
- **Guideline Integration**: Built-in Carbolance brand voice rules, approved language, and formatting.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Store not just content but relationships (a context graph).
- **Shopify Sync**: Direct integration to update product metafields automatically.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Unify content and context for human use and AI assistance.

## Future Considerations

- Transition `space` to become a content & context system over an appropriate timeframe.
- Potential renaming (e.g., `space` → `creative-engine`).
- Graph-style data modeling to connect products, collections, campaigns, and assets.
