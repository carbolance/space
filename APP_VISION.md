# Future System Development (App Vision)

The knowledge_base will eventually evolve into a broader Carbolance **content & context system** — an app that connects copy, assets, and brand guidelines as a full context engine.

## Objectives
- **Front-end Editor**: Rich-text + Markdown editor for non-technical teammates.
- **Guideline Integration**: Built-in Carbolance brand voice rules, approved language, and formatting.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Store not just content but relationships (a context graph).
- **Shopify Sync**: Direct integration to update product metafields automatically.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Unify content and context for human use and AI assistance.

## Future Considerations
- Transition from `knowledge-base` to a broader context system when appropriate.
- Potential renaming (e.g., `knowledge-base` → `context-engine`).
- Graph-style data modeling to connect products, collections, campaigns, and assets.
