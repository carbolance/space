# Future System Development (App Vision)

This `space` will evolve into a **content and context system** â€” an app that connects copy (e.g. brand) and assets as a full creative engine.

Git-based version control will support the system by structuring copy as it relates to assets.

## App Functionality Objectives

* **Front-end Editor**: Simple rich-text + Markdown editor for non-technical teammates.
* **Guideline Integration**: Built-in brand rules, approved language, and formatting.
* **Contextual Retrieval**: Store not just content but relationships (a context graph).
* **Shopify Sync**: Direct integration to update product metafields automatically.
* **Single Source of Truth**: Unify content and context for AI and human use.

## Future Considerations

* Evolve `space` to become a content and context system (a.k.a. `creative-engine`).
* Graph-style data modeling to connect assets, campaigns, collections, and products.
