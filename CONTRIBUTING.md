## Add or Edit Content

1. Create or update Markdown files in the appropriate folder under `library/` (`library/products/`, `library/collections/`, `library/brand/`, `library/seo/`, etc.).
2. Use **kebab-case** for filenames.
3. Keep copy concise and on-brand (see `library/brand/voice-and-tone.md`).

## Commit Style

- Use short, descriptive messages (e.g., `add long sleeve product copy`, `update voice-and-tone.md`).
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for meaningful changes.

## Review

- Optional: open a Pull Request for feedback before merging.
