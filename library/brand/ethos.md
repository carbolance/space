# Ethos

Keep calm

Focus on the present (embrace the moment) instead of what might happen in the future (anxiety) or what happened in the past (regret).

Be mindful of the things that surround you. Appreciate the little things in life.

Trust your instincts and intuition, then act with confidence.

Pay attention to the moment.

Make today better, even if it is only the small things.
