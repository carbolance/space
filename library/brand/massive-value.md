# Massive Value

1. Can you make a product?
2. Do people want to buy your product?
3. Can you make a positive gross margin selling to those people?
4. Can you make a return on the marketing dollars you have to spend to generate that gross profit? Can LTV exceed CAC?
5. Can you scale the amount of money you deploy to your business such that as you grow the return goes up?
6. Can you become a platform by transitioning into a multi-product company by leveraging the user base from the technology you have built?

**Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google raised less than $45M combined before IPO.**
