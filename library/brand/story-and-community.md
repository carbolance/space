# Story and Community

Focus on storytelling and building a community around shared values.

To tell a story, we need to give people a reason to listen. This can be done by appealing to their emotions, values, or aspirations.

To build a community, we need to give people a reason to join. This can be done by creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose, fostering connections between people who share similar interests or values.

We can use storytelling to create a sense of community by sharing stories that resonate with our audience and reflect their values and aspirations. Find common ground that attracts people together to make a group that truly belongs together.

Ultimately, tell great stories and build a great community.
