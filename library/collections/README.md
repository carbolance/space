# Collections

A collection groups products. Keep it simple: reference products by slug or link to the product markdown files.

Examples:

- By slug in YAML front matter (optional for tooling):

```yaml
# title: Essentials
# products:
#   - t-shirt-midnight-black
#   - long-sleeve-t-shirt-midnight-black
```

- Inline links in body:

- [T‑Shirt — Midnight Black](../products/t-shirt-midnight-black.md)
- [Long Sleeve — Midnight Black](../products/long-sleeve-t-shirt-midnight-black.md)
