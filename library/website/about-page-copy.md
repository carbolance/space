Founder

* My name is Dustin Kucko, and you can call me DK. My journey started in 2009 when I earned a degree in chemical engineering and then spent a decade working in biotech. When my son was born in 2016, I spent a lot of time thinking about our future. I ultimately created Carbolance to provide a better life for us and to make progress towards building a sustainable future. Now, my focus is on bringing value to people by creating premium essentials sustainably.
