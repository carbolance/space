Value Marketing

* **The main objection that people have to most ecommerce brands is the price**  
  * Digital acquisition costs can be high  
* Convey the degree that people use the product on a daily basis  
  * **How much time do people spend wearing a shirt? All day?**  
* Talk about the product more as an investment, describing how much the customer will benefit from it using numbers  
  * **Explain how the luxuriously soft and lightweight shirt simply flows with you perfectly throughout the day so that you generally don’t even notice it’s there, but when you do, you love the way it feels**
